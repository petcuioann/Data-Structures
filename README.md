# Data Structures Seminars - Mathematics Specialization
This repository contains the seminars for the Data Structures course, part of the Mathematics Specialization at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Babe»ô-Bolyai University (UBB). The seminars are implemented using C++.

The repository includes various exercises and implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each seminar provides practical applications and algorithmic solutions for working with data structures, helping to deepen the understanding of computational efficiency and memory management.

Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, or contribute!
